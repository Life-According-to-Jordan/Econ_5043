# Econ_5043

Thank you [Dr. Wang](http://www.lewangecon.com/) for teaching a great course! 

All of the homeworks for Managerial Economics 2, Econ 5043, were completed in RStudio and compiled into either .Rmd or .R files. Econ 5043 heavily emphasized statistics with an emphasis on conditional probability to determine the partial impact of an event or variable.
