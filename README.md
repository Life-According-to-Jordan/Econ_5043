### Q1) Covariance and Correlation

- [Correlation vs. Causation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18082/how-would-you-explain-the-difference-between-correlation-and-covariance) 

### Q2) Combined Forecast

Use the data forecast.csv for this question. There are threee variables of interset. The original object of interest, y, and forecasts of y from two different models, forecast1 and forecast2. Use what we learned from class (Application 3: Optimal Forecast Combination), create a combined forecat that could minimize the variance of forecast error. Does it work? Comment on the reason why it may or may not work.

### Q4) Conditional Distribution, Transition Matrix, and Income Mobility

Policymakers and economists are often interested in measuring and understanding income inequality in society. However, as discussed in class, a snapshot of income dispersion in a given time period t, which ignores potential movement over time, does not necessarily give us a good sense of income inequality. A better measure would be to take into account income dynamics for each individual and capture how his/her income moves up and down over his/her life cycle. Transition matrix serves this purpose. Specifically, transition matrix is nothing but a variant of conditional distribution, with each cell being
